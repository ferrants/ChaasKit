# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Usage

### Adding a changeset

When you make changes that should be released, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed (all packages are versioned together in this repo)
2. Choose the bump type (patch/minor/major)
3. Write a summary of the changes

A markdown file will be created in this folder describing the change.

### Releasing

When ready to release:

```bash
pnpm changeset:version  # Bumps versions and updates CHANGELOGs
pnpm changeset:publish  # Publishes to npm
```

## Configuration

This repo uses **fixed versioning** - all packages are always released together at the same version number.
